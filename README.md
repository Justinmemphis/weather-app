## My thoughts with this project:
- finish youtube video of weather app
- learn weather API
- create backend with persistent state
- create replit backend pulling ideal weather conditions for running (temp, humidity, cloud cover, precipitation, sun)
- create automation that calls weather every evening for next day
- create twillio API call that texts me when ideal weather condition tomorrow
- then record video talking about using typescript, nextjs, and tailwind for first time - also expanding app beyond what is available
