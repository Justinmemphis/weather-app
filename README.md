# weather-app
This is a follow-along of a [freeCodeCamp YouTube project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkC_wYM_Co4&) - a weather app webpage.

## How it's made:
Typescript, Tailwind, and next.js - three technologies I haven't used before.

## Optimizations:
For now I'm just following along with the YouTube video.

## Lessons Learned:
I'm enjoying learning the three technologies Typescript, Tailwind, and next.js.  I have used mainly used Create React App for starting React projects so it was interesting to use next.js instead.  I can see the benefit of using Tailwind instead of having regular CSS (or using a preprocessor like Sass).  I can see where Typescript helpfully introduces static typing onto JavaScript.

## Plan for this project:
- finish youtube video of weather app
- ~~learn weather API~~ done
- create backend with persistent state
- create replit backend pulling ideal weather conditions for running (temp, humidity, cloud cover, precipitation, sun)
- create automation that calls weather every evening for next day
- create twillio API call that texts me when ideal weather condition tomorrow
- then record video talking about using typescript, nextjs, and tailwind for first time - also expanding app beyond what is available
